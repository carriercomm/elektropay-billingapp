Elektropay Cloud Billing App


Introduction

Elektropay Cloud Billing provides an expressive, fluent interface to global payment providers, banks, Bitcoin and subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.
